(function() {
  // Let's return to our gameBoard now.
    // Step back up to just before we started the reduce mini-sprint to
    //  remind yourself what we were doing.

  // First, note that in this file we still have access to our gameBoard object.
    //  This is because in boardBasics.js we put it on the window object.
    //  You can test this by trying to print the gameBoard variable to the console:

  // console.log('gameBoard object in gamePieces.js is:', gameBoard);

  // Remember that we'd just used each and filter
    //  to find all the gamePieces on the board:
    //    "results after filter: [Array[0], Array[0], Array[0], Array[3], Array[0], Array[2], Array[0], Array[0]]"

    //  for a gameBoard that has
    //    three gamePieces on row 3 and
    //    two game pieces on row 5.

  // Having that information scattered throughout a bunch of different arrays
    //    seems messy.
    //    You can probably think of plenty of cases where we'd want to have
    //    all that information collected into a single array.
    //  Wait, that's starting to sound like reduce!
    //    We're taking a collection of a bunch of things,
    //    and reducing it down to a single thing.

    // Can you think of a way we could reduce
    //  an array filled with arrays to a single array
    //  filled with all the values contained in each subarray?
      // Hint: what if we tried passing in an empty array as the starting value?

  // This ends our intro to the capstone project.
    //  By this point you should be pretty familiar with
    //  - the gameBoard,
    //  - the makePiece function, and
    //  - all four of the main functional programming tools
    //    (each, map, filter, and reduce).
    //  From here on out, we're intentionally going to give you less guidance.
    //  One of the key skills to be a successful engineer is autonomy in
    //    accomplishing tasks that are given to you.
    //  We want you to get used to that feeling with these upcoming exercises.


  // 1. Create an array called piecesToAdd that
  //  holds the names of each of the pieces we'll create for each player.
      //  For example:
      //  ['kuddlyKoala', 'babyDino','babyDino', 'babyDino', 'fierceDragon', 'lazyPanda', 'lazyPanda']

  // 2. Create an array of the playerNames.
    //  For example: ['hermoineGranger', 'graceHopper']

  // 3. Now use two (nested) each loops to add these pieces to the board.
  //  Remember that we have the makePiece function!

    // Question1:
      //  How can you make sure each piece ends up
      //  on a different square on the board?

    // Question2:
      //  What happens when you get to the end of a line?

      //  How do you know to start on the first position of the next line?

      //  Think if you can use the modulus "%" operator for this.
        //  If you're not familiar with the modulus operator,
        //  it gives you the remainder from dividing two numbers.
        //  So if we divide 12 by 8, that gives us a remainder of 4
        //  (we have 4 left over after taking 8 out of 12).
        //  As always, feel free to google around for more information!

    // Question3:
      //  How can we line these pieces up on opposite sides of the board?

    // BEST PRACTICE:
      //  Pseudocode the specific steps you'll need to accomplish.
      //  This takes a seemingly large and complex task and
      //  breaks it down into solvable chunks.

  // 4. Great!
    //  Now we have two fierce opposing armies arranged on the board.
    //    (or two groups of friends just trying to gather together
    //    on the same square for a group hug?!)

    //  It's time to make them look intimidating, or pretty
    //    for their impending battle, or hugfest.
    //  Let's use a couple of our functional programming skills here.
    //    We'll chain them together,slowly building up
    //  to do some fairly complex operations.

      // A. Use filter to iterate through a single row,
        //  returning an arr of the squareObj (s) in that row
        //  that have a gamePiece on them.

      // B. Use map to change each of the objects
        //  in the array returned from filter
        //  to an array of their positions.
        //  Positions are a property saved as a property on each object.
        //  Console.log each object to check it out!

      // C. Use each or map to repeat this process on each row in your gameBoard.
        //  At this point, you should have an array of subarrays.
        //  Each of those subarrays will contain the positions of
        //  the squares in a given row that have a gamePiece on them.

      // D. Now, let's use reduce to reduce this down to a single array
        //  that contains the position of all the squares we're interested in.

    // Whew!
    // You've now used all four of
    // the canonical functional programming functions!
      //  Great job getting here.

    //  Now we have a single array that holds the position of all the gamePieces.
    //  Let's use each to go through that array
      //  and do something with each item in that array.
      //  Except we're going to use it in a slightly creative way
        //    (yay for creativity in programming!
        //    And here my momma thought I'd never be an artist.).

      //  We're going to use each item in the positionsArray as
      //    information to go find the gamePiece at that position.

      //  Then, once we have those gamePieces, let's
      //    add an imageURL to each gamePiece
      //    so we can see the gamePieces on the board.

      //  imageURL is just a property on each object.
      //    All you need to do is add a link to an image.
        //  If you haven't done this before,
        //  you can right click on any image online,
        //  and get a link to that image.
        //  Set the imageURL property equal to that string, and voila!
        //  Your image will appear on the screen.

  // 5. Use filter to grab all gamePieces of the same type, and
    //  then use each to iterate through them and set their movement descriptions.
      //  Don't worry about building out the logic of how you'd make them move
      //  - for now just have fun coming up with moves
      //  you'd want your various pieces to do.
      //  For example, maybe scaredKitty goes and hides in the corner,
      //  and impetuousDragon frequently flies off and leaves the board entirely.

  // 6. Use reduce to create an object that has a tally of all our gamePieces.

    //  For example, the result might be:
      // { babyDino: 3,
      //   impetutousDragon: 2,
      //   scaredKitty: 4,
      //   hobblingPirate:8,
      //   groupHuggers:12 }

    //  You should be able to do this from scratch by
    //  just using reduce inside of another reduce if you're feeling ambitious!

  // CARRY ON...
  //  You're doing great!!!
  //  Go ahead and check out the file called
  //    '4_gamePlay.js'
  //  in the yourOwnGame folder for more fun!
